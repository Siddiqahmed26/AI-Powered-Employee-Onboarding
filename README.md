# AI-Powered Employee Onboarding & Goal Navigator

**Live Demo**: [https://ai-powered-employee-onboarding.vercel.app/](https://ai-powered-employee-onboarding.vercel.app/)

Welcome to the **Goal Navigator** application! This platform is designed to streamline internal communications, modernize the new joinee onboarding flow, and keep organizational day-to-day operations focused and accessible.

## 🚀 Purpose

When successfully hosted, the Goal Navigator acts as a unified hub tailored for employees to orient themselves within the company ecosystem. Its primary capabilities include:

- **AI-Driven Onboarding**: An interactive AI chat bot that greets new joinees, assesses their role & department, and dynamically curates their onboarding experience.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Centralizing important metrics, outstanding daily tasks, and unread chat notifications.
- **People Directory**: A beautifully crafted colleague repository where employees can discover teammates, view comprehensive profiles (skills, roles, locations, new joinee badges), and effortlessly draft "Coffee Chat" networking emails to them.
- **Internal Messaging (Context Chat)**: Persistent, database-supported messaging channels between colleagues to promote communication across departments seamlessly.
- **Day Plans & Goal Tracking**: Keep track of daily checklists and ongoing projects with integrated persistence.
